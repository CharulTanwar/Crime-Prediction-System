# Project Title

Crime prediction project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast where and when crimes are likely to occur. 


## Overview of Project

By studying past crime data like the type of crime, location, and time, we can create models to find patterns and trends in criminal behavior. These models help police and policymakers use resources better, focus on preventing crime, and keep communities safer. Using data and predictions, crime prevention projects aim to reduce crime and make communities healthier and safer.
